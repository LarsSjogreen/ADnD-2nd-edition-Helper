# ADnD-2nd-edition-helper

Just goofing around, implementing (very small parts of) the AD&D 2nd edition Players Handbook rules for creating a character.

## Development philosophy
Move fast, break things. Settle with good enough or worse. (See [The Cult of done manifesto](http://www.manifestoproject.it/bre-pettis-and-kio-stark/).)

## Things to do in near time
* Make the web page look more nicer
* Add a menu to the web page
* Add a csv file reader that can be used for adding attribute bonuses

## Ideas for the future
* NPC generator
* Using Buefy to make it look a bit nicer
* PDF generator for character sheet
* Treasure-, dungeon- and other generator tables

## Purpose of this project
Happy coding therapy. The software will (and should) probably never be used.
