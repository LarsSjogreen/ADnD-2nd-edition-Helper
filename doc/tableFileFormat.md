# Format of the attribute table files

* CSV files
* First column is the attribute value
* Subsequent columns are the bonus. The column name is used as property name for the stats object

## Ideas for the future

* Meta-file listing all files and the attributes that they connect to
* Finding out a way to describe attribute limits (class, race etc.) in a compact way
